# ParkLogic — QR-Based Truck Parking Management System

## Overview

A full-stack Next.js 16 parking management system for a single truck parking lot in Texas.
Drivers scan a QR code at the gate, check in via their phone (no app download), pay, and
get assigned a spot. The admin (lot owner) manages everything from a mobile-friendly dashboard.

**Stack**: Next.js 16 App Router, Prisma 7.5 + Neon PostgreSQL, QuickBooks Payments (branch),
Tailwind v4, Vercel hosting.

**Branches**:
- `main` — production-stable, deployed to Vercel. Payment disabled for testing.
- `quickbooks-payments` — QB Payments integration (hosted checkout, OAuth, reconciliation).
  NOT merged to main yet. Has its own payment flow, QB token management, and Payments tab.
- `square-payments` — abandoned Square integration branch. Do not use.

 /exit    /extend          /checkin (new session)
   │         │
 exited   /confirmation → /welcome

Gate QR codes (two physical laminated QR codes):
  Entry gate → /entry (auto-opens gate if active session)
  Exit gate  → /exit  (auto-opens gate, shows session info)
```

**Entry page flow** (`/entry`):
1. Mount: check `parking_driver` in localStorage
2. If saved: verify against `GET /api/drivers?phone=X` (ID must match)
3. Check allow list first (`GET /api/allowlist?phone=X`) — if on list, gate opens, no session needed
4. If driver verified: check `activeSessions` in the API response
   - ACTIVE session → auto-fire `POST /api/gate` (direction=ENTRANCE), show session info
   - OVERSTAY → show fee screen, link to `/exit` for settlement
   - No session → "Welcome back, check in" screen
5. If not saved: show "New driver / Returning driver" menu
6. Phone lookup → if has active session, gate opens immediately
7. Gate only auto-fires on fresh external navigation (not refresh, not internal link)

**Exit page flow** (`/exit`):
1. Same identity flow as entry
2. ACTIVE session → auto-fire `POST /api/gate` (direction=EXIT), show "Gate opening, spot still reserved"
3. OVERSTAY → show fee + "Settle overstay & open gate" button (calls `POST /api/sessions/exit`)
4. No session → "No active session" message

---

## Session Model

Sessions are **time-based reservations** (hotel model), NOT gate passes.

- **Session = reservation.** Driver pays for X hours or X months, spot is theirs until `expectedEnd`.
- **Gate is decoupled from session.** Both entry and exit scans call `POST /api/gate`
  which opens the gate and logs the direction. Neither ends the session.
- **Sessions expire by time.** When `expectedEnd` passes → grace period → cron flips
  to OVERSTAY → manager walks lot and overrides false positives.
- **No explicit checkout.** Scan, gate opens, drive through. No prompts.
- **Overstay settlement** uses `POST /api/sessions/exit` — only called when a driver
  is overstayed and pays the fee. This + manager override are the only paths that
  complete a session programmatically.
- **Pricing tiers**: Hourly (1-72h) and Monthly (1-12 months). Selected at check-in.
  Monthly sessions just set `expectedEnd` further out — same gate/overstay logic.

## Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)

Six tabs:

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Overview** | Live lot map (LotMapViewer) with spot status colors. Click a spot for detail panel. |
| **Sessions** | Filterable session list (All/Active/Overstay/Completed). Expandable rows with driver/vehicle/timing/payments. Admin actions: Extend Time, Close & Backdate, Cancel Session. |
| **Payments** | Revenue chart (30-day bar graph), summary cards, payment list with QB deep-links (Invoice ↗, Customer ↗, Refund ↗), QB reconciliation with unmatched payment flags. |
| **Drivers** | Searchable driver list with edit (name/email/phone), vehicle info, active session status. |
| **Log** | Audit event feed with filter chips (Entry, Exit, Extension, Overstay, Gate, Admin, Notification, Security). All gate opens, denials, suspicious entries logged. |
| **Settings** | Rates (hourly, monthly, overstay), notifications, spot config, payment toggle, bobtail overflow, parking terms (clickwrap), QB connection, allow list management. |

**Auth**: JWT cookie via `src/proxy.ts` (Next.js 16 convention, not `middleware.ts`). Admin password in env var. 8-hour token expiry.

---

## Gate Security

**Layer 1 (DONE):** `POST /api/gate` requires a valid `sessionId` OR `allowListPhone`.
Validates session exists, is ACTIVE or OVERSTAY, driver matches. OVERSTAY sessions can
exit but not enter. Rejects with 403 + logs `GATE_DENIED` with full details.

**Allow list path**: `POST /api/gate` with `allowListPhone` — checks AllowList table,
opens gate if active, logs `ALLOWLIST_ENTRY`. No session needed.

**Refresh protection**: Entry page auto-gate only fires on fresh external navigation
(PerformanceNavigationTiming + document.referrer check). Refresh, back button, internal
links, and shared URLs do NOT trigger the gate — shows "Please re-scan QR" instead.

**Device tracking**: `parking_device_id` in localStorage (survives driver resets).
Sent with every gate call. Two consecutive ENTRANCEs from different devices on the
same session → `SUSPICIOUS_ENTRY` logged.

**Layer 2 (TODO):** Dynamic QR codes with short-lived tokens.
**Layer 3 (TODO):** Hardware-level auth (Shelly WiFi relay on private network).

## Data Model (Prisma)

**Enums**: `VehicleType` (BOBTAIL, TRUCK_TRAILER), `SpotStatus` (AVAILABLE, OCCUPIED),
`SessionStatus` (ACTIVE, COMPLETED, OVERSTAY), `PaymentType` (CHECKIN, MONTHLY_CHECKIN,
EXTENSION, OVERSTAY), `AuditAction` (15 values including GATE_DENIED, SUSPICIOUS_ENTRY,
ALLOWLIST_ENTRY, LAYOUT_SAVED, LAYOUT_RESTORED, PAYMENT_EXPIRED).

**Key models**:
- `Driver` — phone (unique), name, email, qbCustomerId (QB link)
- `Vehicle` — driverId FK, unitNumber, licensePlate, type, nickname
- `Spot` — label (unique), type, cx/cy/w/h/rot (SVG layout), archivedAt
- `Session` — driverId, vehicleId, spotId, startedAt, expectedEnd, status,
  termsVersion, overstayAuthorized, spotLabelSnapshot (frozen at check-in)
- `Payment` — sessionId, type, externalPaymentId (QB invoice/charge ID), amount,
  status (COMPLETED/REFUNDED/VOIDED/DISPUTED), refundedAmount, refundExternalId
- `AuditLog` — action, sessionId?, driverId?, vehicleId?, spotId?, details
- `Settings` — all config in one row (rates, terms, QB tokens, lotGroups JSON)
- `AllowList` — phone (unique), name, label (Employee/Family/Vendor/Contractor), active
- `LotLayoutVersion` — append-only history for the lot editor (snapshot + diff per save). See `docs/LOT_HISTORY.md`.

**Full schema walkthrough**: `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`. **Lot editor history + session-label
snapshot details**: `docs/LOT_HISTORY.md`.

## Key Conventions

- **localStorage**: single key `parking_driver` via `src/lib/driver-store.ts` — never use raw localStorage
- **Device ID**: `parking_device_id` via `getDeviceId()` — persists across driver resets
- **Fetch**: always use `apiFetch` / `apiPost` from `src/lib/fetch.ts` — throws on non-2xx
- **Identity**: localStorage is never trusted — always verify against `/api/drivers?phone=X` before prefilling
- **Session status lifecycle**: ACTIVE → OVERSTAY (cron) → COMPLETED (exit/override)
- **Shared types**: `src/types/domain.ts` — never define inline Driver/Vehicle/Session types in pages
- **Phone numbers**: always use `<PhoneInput>` component, store digits-only in DB
- **Payment IDs**: stored in `externalPaymentId` field (provider-agnostic, currently QB)
- **Admin auth**: proxy.ts (Next.js 16 convention), JWT in httpOnly cookie
- **Lot layout**: stored in DB (Spot.cx/cy/w/h/rot + Settings.lotGroups JSON), NOT localStorage. Every save writes a `LotLayoutVersion` row. The editor never hard-deletes — removed spots get `archivedAt` set so session/payment FKs stay valid. Live queries filter `archivedAt: null`; history queries don't. See `docs/LOT_HISTORY.md`.
- **Session spot labels**: never render `session.spot.label` directly in historical views — use `getSessionSpotLabel()` from `src/lib/sessions.ts`, which prefers `Session.spotLabelSnapshot` (frozen at check-in). Only the live lot map uses the current `Spot.label`.
- **Color theme**: forest green `#2D7A4A` primary accent, dark theme `#1C1C1E` on admin/entry/exit
- **Mobile**: `useIsMobile()` hook at 640px breakpoint, admin dashboard fully responsive

## Pending / TODO

### Before launch (critical path)
1. **Shelly gate controller** — replace `triggerGateOpen()` stub in `src/lib/gate.ts`
   with HTTP call to WiFi relay
2. **QuickBooks integration** — merge `quickbooks-payments` branch after QB developer
   account is fully set up and tested. Needs:
   - QB app redirect URI configured: `{BASE_URL}/api/admin/qb-auth/callback`
   - Admin connects QB from Settings tab
   - Test hosted checkout end-to-end with sandbox credentials
3. **Cron scheduling** — Vercel Hobby allows daily cron only. Need external cron
   (cron-job.org) or Railway for 5-minute intervals (overstay detection)
4. **Environment variables on Vercel** — AUTH_SECRET (random 32+ chars),
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL (actual domain), QB credentials when ready
5. **Terms text** — have a Texas attorney review the placeholder terms in Settings
6. **Seed production lot** — run seed script with actual lot layout positions

### Post-launch
- SMS notifications (Twilio) — stubs ready in `src/lib/notifications.ts`
- Dynamic QR codes (Layer 2 gate security)
- Hardware auth (Layer 3 — Shelly on private network)
- Driver discount system (discount field on Driver model)
- Reserved monthly spots (tie specific spots to monthly drivers)
- Auto-renewal for monthly sessions
- Railway migration (if Vercel cron limits are insufficient)
