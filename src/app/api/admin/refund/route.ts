/**
 * POST /api/admin/refund — admin-initiated Stripe refund.
 *
 * This route does NOT mutate the `Payment` row. It only calls Stripe's
 * Refund API. The `charge.refunded` webhook is the single writer of
 * `stripeRefundId`, `refundedAmount`, `refundedAt`, and `status`, and is
 * also responsible for writing the QB Refund Receipt. Keeping that writer
 * single-threaded through the webhook is what makes partial refunds +
 * Stripe-initiated refunds (e.g. from the dashboard) behave the same way
 * as admin-initiated ones.
 *
 * The admin UI polls the Payment row for `refundedAt` to update.
